# Evaluate_Anisotropy
To calculate a variety of anisotropy measures for a given dataset of UHECR arrival directions
Wish-list: 
- correlation functions (2pt, 3pt, 2pt+)
- spatial power spectrum (dipole, quadrupole) 
- cross-correlations (eg with catalogues of candidate sources)
- source significances (Li-Ma statistics)
